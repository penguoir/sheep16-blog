In this meeting, we mainly worked on setting up and fixing problems with the teams development environments. We also went through how to make a pull request, and had some team members do so live. We worked on adding menu items to the footer of the webpage, as well as adding some more static pages to the site.

In the coming week, we would like to continue working on the Github issues we have set for ourselves, all to do with the development of the website.
